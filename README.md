# Deep_Learning

Welcome to the Deep Learning Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly deep learning projects covering a wide range of applications. Whether you're new to the field or looking for hands-on practice, you'll find these projects a great way to dive into the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.


# Projects
Here are the projects included in this repository:

## Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): 
Build a CNN to classify images of cats and dogs. You'll learn about convolutional layers, pooling layers, and how to fine-tune a pre-trained model.

## Movie Recommender with Collaborative Filtering: 
Create a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. You'll explore user-item interactions and provide personalized movie recommendations.

## MNIST Digit Classification with Deep Neural Networks: 
Implement a deep neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. You'll preprocess the data and build a model for digit recognition.
